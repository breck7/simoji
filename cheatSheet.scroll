title Simoji Quickstart Guide

startColumns 3

* Simoji is a language and tool for thinkers to write shareable simulations using üòÉ's. You write your simulations in a simple language using mostly Emojis and then click play. Simoji is public domain, open source, and suggestions welcome!

# Example Program
code
 comment Define an ant agent
 üêú
  comment Ants turn then move one space per tick
  onTick
   turnRandomly
   move
  comment Ants pick up food.
  onHit
   ü•ñ
    pickItUp
  
 comment Define an ant hill
 ‚õ∞
  comment On each tick, with 5% odds
  onTick 0.05 
   comment Spawn an ant
   spawn üêú
  
 ü•ñ
  
 comment Set up the board.
 insert 3 ü•ñ
 insert 1 ‚õ∞


# Concepts
## Board
* The Board is the rectangle on which your simulation takes place. It has a width and height and is divided into a grid.

## Agents
* Agents are the key concept in Simoji. Everything you see on your board is an agent. In the code above, the ant, hill, and food are all agent types.

## Events
* Events are blocks of commands that execute during the running of the experiments. Probabilities can be assigned so blocks run stochastically.
- onTick
- onHit
- onTouch
- onDeath

* Some events can also happen on the board level:
- onTick
- onExtinct

## Commands
- kickIt
- replaceWith
- spawn
- remove
- pickItUp
- turnRandomly
- turnToward

## Attributes
* Agents can have attributes. You can define your own. Some are built in like:
- health

* Some attributes are booleans with only 2 states like:
- solid
- bouncy

## Experiments
* You can run multiple boards at the same time using the `experiment` keyword. You can tweak any words in your experiments. Usually you want to change Settings. The maximum boards at one time is currently 4.

## Parameters
* You can define parameters that you use throughout your simulation code. This makes it easy to tweak them in experiments. For example:

code
 lightningFrequencySetting .1
 
 experiment
  comment Lots of lightning
  lightningFrequencySetting .5

## Reports
* Data is collected during the running of every experiment. You can export this data to CSV and/or start analyizing it immediately in the Ohayo app.

## Board Setup
* You can setup your board with the following commands.
- insert
- paste

## Agent Palette
* You can drop new Agents onto your board using the Agent Palette on the right side of your screen.

# Tree Notation
* Simoji the language is a Tree Language. There are no visible syntax characters. Indentation is used for parent/child relationships. Here is the grammar.

# Sharing Your Simulations
* At the top of the page you should see a link that you can copy and paste to share your sim. When you update your simulation code that link will update.

## Loading a Simulation from a URL
* You can load any simulation from a publicly accessible URL by prefixing it with: `https://simoji.pub/#url `. For example: https://simoji.pub/#url%20https://simoji.pub/examples/eatTheBacon.simoji

# Getting Involved
* The source code for Simoji and all development happens on Github.
